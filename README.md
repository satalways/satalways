## Hi there 👋

## 👋 Hi there, I’m **Shakeel Ahmed** — but you’ll see me around GitHub as **@satalways**

- 🏠 Lahore, Pakistan | 🖥️ Working remotely as a **Freelance Full-Stack PHP/MySQL Developer**
- 🔭 **Currently building:**  
  - Modern Laravel 12 + Livewire 3 admin dashboards  
  - An online desi-food ordering platform (bindia.dk) that integrates Wolt delivery & gift-card payments  
- 🛠 **Tech I enjoy:** PHP • Laravel • Livewire • Filament • MySQL • Alpine.js • Tailwind CSS • JavaScript/React  
- 🧩 **Side projects:** WordPress plugins like **Social Share Buttons** & **Content Expiry Notice**, and a tiny React colour-generator.  
- 📚 **Learning & tinkering:** clean architecture in Laravel, queue optimisation, Docker for local dev, and a pinch of AI-assisted coding.  
- 🤝 **Open to collaborate** on Laravel/WordPress tooling, API integrations, or performance-focused refactors.  
- 🌐 **Portfolio / blog:** [shakeel.pk](https://www.shakeel.pk)  
- 💬 **Let’s talk code:** Create an issue, open a PR, or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shakeel-ahmed-4740a212).  
- ☕ **Fun fact:** When I’m not shipping features, you’ll catch me refining a cup of desi chai or reading courtroom stories for my next YouTube narration.

> “Clean code, happy users, and learning something new every day.” – that’s the motto I commit with every push. 🚀
